# Claude.md Creative Uses Collection

A curated repository of innovative and creative implementations of CLAUDE.md files for [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code), Anthropic's agentic coding assistant.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository showcases creative ways developers are using CLAUDE.md files to enhance their Claude Code workflows. From simple productivity hacks to complex multi-agent orchestration systems, these examples demonstrate the flexibility and power of Claude Code's configuration system.

## üìö What is CLAUDE.md?

CLAUDE.md is a special markdown file that Claude Code automatically reads when starting a session in a project directory. It serves as:

- **Project Context**: Provides Claude with understanding of your codebase, conventions, and requirements
- **Command Storage**: Stores frequently used commands (build, test, lint) for quick access
- **Style Guide**: Documents coding preferences, naming conventions, and best practices
- **Persistent Memory**: Maintains important information across Claude Code sessions

## üöÄ Examples in This Repository

### 1. **General Usage** (`/examples/general/`)
- **arguments.md**: Demonstrates the use of `$ARGUMENTS` in custom slash commands
- Basic patterns for command templating and parameter passing

### 2. **Infinite Agent Loop** (`/examples/infinite_agent_loop/`)
An ambitious conceptual system for orchestrating unlimited parallel AI agents:
- **infinite-agent-loop.md**: Main orchestration engine specification
- **infinite-agent-components.md**: Component definitions and patterns
- **infinite-agent-loop-glossary.md**: Comprehensive terminology guide

*Note: This is a creative interpretation that extends beyond Claude Code's built-in capabilities*

### 3. **Multi-Agent Coordination** (`/examples/multi_agent_coordination/`)
- **claude-sparc.md**: The SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology for structured development

### 4. **Simon Couch's Patterns** (`/examples/simon_couch/`)
- **content-injection.md**: Innovative technique for injecting external documentation and context into Claude Code sessions

## üí° Key Patterns and Techniques

### Official Claude Code Features
- **Custom Slash Commands**: Store reusable prompts in `.claude/commands/` directory
- **$ARGUMENTS Variable**: Pass dynamic parameters to custom commands
- **Headless Mode**: Run Claude Code non-interactively with `-p` flag
- **Git Worktrees**: Work on multiple tasks in parallel with isolated environments

### Creative Extensions
- **Variable Interpolation Systems**: Using template-like syntax for dynamic content
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple Claude instances
- **Context Injection**: Loading external documentation into working memory
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Evolving strategies based on iteration count

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use These Examples

1. **Study the Patterns**: Each example demonstrates different approaches to enhancing Claude Code
2. **Adapt to Your Needs**: Modify the examples to fit your specific workflow
3. **Create Your Own**: Use these as inspiration for your own creative implementations
4. **Share Your Ideas**: Contribute your own innovative uses back to the community

## üìù Creating Your Own CLAUDE.md

Basic structure for a CLAUDE.md file:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview
Brief description of your project and its purpose.

## Key Commands
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Coding Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Prefer functional components in React

## Project Structure
- `/src` - Source code
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation

## Special Instructions
Any project-specific guidance for Claude Code...
```

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you've discovered a creative use of CLAUDE.md files:

1. Create a new directory under `/examples/` with a descriptive name
2. Add your CLAUDE.md example(s) with clear documentation
3. Include a README explaining your approach and use case
4. Submit a pull request with a description of your innovation

## üìö Resources

- [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)
- [Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)
- [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Some examples (like the Infinite Agent Loop) are conceptual designs that extend beyond Claude Code's current capabilities
- Always distinguish between official features and creative interpretations
- Test thoroughly when implementing complex patterns
- Consider API usage costs when running parallel agents

## üåü Highlights

- **Most Practical**: Simon Couch's content injection technique for documentation
- **Most Ambitious**: The Infinite Agent Loop parallel generation system
- **Most Structured**: SPARC methodology for systematic development
- **Most Accessible**: Basic $ARGUMENTS usage in custom commands
