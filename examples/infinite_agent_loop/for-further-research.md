# Undocumented Features for Further Research

## Research Status: Fully Complete (June 11, 2025)

**Major Finding**: The infinite agent loop pattern is largely conceptual. Most described features do not exist as native Claude Code capabilities. See `research/RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md` for comprehensive findings.
