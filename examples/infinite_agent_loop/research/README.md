# Infinite Agent Loop Research Index

## Research Completed: June 11, 2025

This directory contains comprehensive research into the "Infinite Agentic Loop" pattern described in the ClaudeMD examples. Our investigation reveals that this pattern is primarily conceptual, with most features requiring external implementation rather than being native Claude Code capabilities.

## Key Discoveries

### ‚úÖ What's Real
- Custom slash commands with `$ARGUMENTS`
- Headless mode (`-p` flag)
- Git worktrees for parallel instances
- File-based context sharing
- Basic session persistence
- Limited sub-agent research capabilities

### ‚ùå What's Fictional
- `/agent` command
- Advanced variable interpolation
- Automatic wave execution
- Built-in orchestration
- Complex command syntax
- Native iteration management

## Implementation Guide

To implement the infinite loop pattern, you need:
1. External orchestration scripts (Python/Bash)
2. Custom variable interpolation
3. Manual state management
4. Process coordination tools
5. Error handling and recovery

## Conclusion
The infinite agent loop represents an inspiring vision for AI orchestration that pushes beyond Claude Code's intentionally minimal design. While not natively supported, the pattern demonstrates what's possible with creative engineering built on Claude Code's simple foundation.
