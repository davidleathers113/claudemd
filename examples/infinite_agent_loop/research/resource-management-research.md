# Research: Resource Management

## Summary
Claude Code has sophisticated rate limiting tied to subscription plans, with API usage counting against shared limits. While parallel execution is supported, resource management for infinite loops requires careful external orchestration to avoid hitting limits.

## Key Findings

### 1. API Credit Consumption Patterns

**Pro Plan ($20/month)**
- ~45 messages every 5 hours (Claude chat)
- ~10-40 prompts every 5 hours (Claude Code)
- Shared limit across Claude and Claude Code
- All activity counts against same quota

**API Usage Tiers**
- Monthly spend limits per tier
- Must wait for next month if limit reached
- Standard API rates apply (distinct from Pro/Max)
- Automatic tier progression based on usage

**Rate Limit Measurements**
- Requests per minute (RPM)
- Input tokens per minute (ITPM)
- Output tokens per minute (OTPM)
- Limits vary by model class

### 2. Parallel Execution Limits

**Native Support**
- Models can use tools in parallel
- AsyncAnthropic enables parallel API requests
- Independent requests can be parallelized
- Better instruction following in parallel mode

**Practical Limits**
- No hard limit on parallel instances mentioned
- Constrained by rate limits (RPM/ITPM/OTPM)
- ~10 agents mentioned as practical maximum
- API quota shared across all instances

**Memory Capabilities**
- Opus 4 excels with local file access
- Creates "memory files" for continuity
- Maintains tacit knowledge over time
- Example: Navigation guides for complex tasks

### 3. Storage Optimization

**Prompt Caching**
- Caches prompt prefixes for reuse
- Saves time and resources on repeated queries
- Up to 1 hour cache duration (new API feature)
- Automatic matching and retrieval

**Conversation Management**
- Start new conversations to reduce token usage
- Claude re-reads entire conversation each message
- Batch multiple questions in single message
- Reduces redundant processing

**Memory Files (Opus 4)**
- Stores key information persistently
- Enables long-term task awareness
- Improves coherence across sessions
- Developer must provide file access

### 4. Rate Limiting Behavior

**Error Handling**
- HTTP 429 errors for rate limit exceeded
- Exponential backoff recommended
- Automatic retry with delays
- Clear error messages provided

**Mitigation Strategies**
- Spread requests over time
- Implement request queuing
- Monitor usage programmatically
- Plan for rate limit windows

## Implementation Strategies

### For Infinite Agent Loops

1. **Token Budget Management**
```python
class ResourceManager:
    def __init__(self, max_rpm=100, max_itpm=100000):
        self.max_rpm = max_rpm
        self.max_itpm = max_itpm
        self.current_rpm = 0
        self.current_itpm = 0
        
    def can_spawn_agent(self, estimated_tokens):
        return (self.current_rpm < self.max_rpm and 
                self.current_itpm + estimated_tokens < self.max_itpm)
    
    def wait_for_capacity(self):
        # Implement exponential backoff
        time.sleep(min(2 ** self.retry_count, 60))
```

2. **Parallel Execution Control**
```bash
# Limit concurrent agents
MAX_AGENTS=5
current_agents=0

spawn_agent() {
    if [ $current_agents -lt $MAX_AGENTS ]; then
        ((current_agents++))
        claude -p "$1" &
        wait_for_completion
        ((current_agents--))
    else
        echo "Waiting for capacity..."
        sleep 60
    fi
}
```

3. **Storage Optimization**
- Use shared context files
- Implement summary generation
- Clean up temporary files
- Compress historical data

### Best Practices Discovered

1. **Quota Management**
   - Track usage across all instances
   - Implement daily/hourly budgets
   - Alert before hitting limits
   - Plan maintenance windows

2. **Efficient Prompting**
   - Batch related operations
   - Reuse cached prompts
   - Minimize conversation length
   - Start fresh sessions regularly

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Queue failed requests
   - Log all API responses
   - Monitor error patterns

## Limitations for Infinite Loops

1. **Hard Stop at Limits**
   - No unlimited usage tier
   - Monthly caps cannot be exceeded
   - Shared limits across all tools
   - No way to purchase extra credits

2. **No Native Resource Management**
   - External tracking required
   - Manual quota distribution
   - No built-in throttling
   - Limited visibility into usage

3. **Storage Constraints**
   - File system limits apply
   - No automatic cleanup
   - Memory files grow unbounded
   - Manual maintenance needed

## Comparison Table

| Resource Type | Claude Code Reality | Infinite Loop Need |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| API Credits | Hard monthly limits | Unlimited usage |
| Parallel Agents | Soft limit ~10 | Hundreds/thousands |
| Storage | Manual management | Auto-optimization |
| Rate Limiting | Per-minute caps | Continuous flow |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement usage tracking wrapper
2. Create resource pooling system
3. Design graceful degradation
4. Plan for limit scenarios

### Long-term Solutions
1. Distribute across multiple accounts
2. Implement caching layer
3. Create offline processing queue
4. Design resumable workflows

### Cost Optimization
1. Use prompt caching aggressively
2. Minimize context per agent
3. Batch similar operations
4. Clean up resources promptly

## API Features for Resource Management

**New in Claude 4**
- Code execution tool
- MCP connector
- Files API
- 1-hour prompt caching
- Background tasks via GitHub Actions
- Native IDE integrations

**Missing Features**
- Programmatic usage queries
- Dynamic rate limit adjustment
- Usage prediction APIs
- Resource reservation system

## Conclusion

While Claude Code provides sophisticated rate limiting and some optimization features, implementing true infinite agent loops faces fundamental resource constraints. The shared usage limits, lack of unlimited tiers, and absence of native resource management APIs mean that any infinite loop implementation must include extensive external resource management, careful budgeting, and graceful handling of limit scenarios. The pattern is theoretically possible but practically constrained by economic and technical limits.
