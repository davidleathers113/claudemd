# Research: Context Window Optimization

## Summary
Claude Code provides real context window management features including the `/compact` command and automatic compacting, but advanced features like rolling summaries and automatic pruning for infinite loops are conceptual extensions requiring external implementation.

## Key Findings

### 1. Real Claude Code Features

**Real-Time Context Visualization**
- Percentage indicator shows context window usage
- Visible in terminal during operation
- Enables proactive management before hitting limits
- User can monitor and act before context overflow

**The `/compact` Command**
- Intelligent summarization of conversation history
- Maintains crucial project details and code snippets
- Prioritizes implementation details over general discussion
- Single command operation - no manual selection required
- Revolutionary for long-running projects

**Automatic Context Management**
- Recent updates include auto-compacting features
- Still under development based on user requests
- Issue #92 on GitHub tracks automatic management progress
- Aims to shield users from implementation details

**CLAUDE.md Integration**
- Special file automatically pulled into context
- Provides persistent project context efficiently
- Reduces need for repeated explanations
- Optimizes token usage at conversation start

### 2. Claude 4 Memory Features

**Memory File Creation**
- Can extract key information from documents
- Creates summary files for future reference
- Maintains knowledge across sessions
- Requires appropriate file permissions

**Session Persistence**
- Solves "amnesia problem" for long projects
- Context maintained over days/weeks
- Key information preserved between runs
- Enables true project continuity

### 3. Conceptual Extensions (Not Native)

**Rolling Summary Generation**
- Would require external implementation
- Could use Claude to periodically summarize progress
- Store summaries in designated files
- Manually feed back to new instances

**Automatic Context Pruning**
- Not built into Claude Code
- Would need external monitoring of context usage
- Could trigger `/compact` programmatically
- Requires wrapper scripts or tools

**Memory Management Strategies**
- External tools needed for sophisticated management
- Could implement LRU cache for context items
- Priority-based retention policies
- Checkpoint and restore mechanisms

**Context Sharing Protocols**
- No native protocol for sharing context
- File-based sharing remains primary method
- Would require standardized format
- External synchronization needed

## Practical Implementation

### Current Best Practices

1. **Monitor Context Usage**
   - Watch percentage indicator
   - Use `/compact` proactively
   - Don't wait for limits

2. **Optimize CLAUDE.md**
   - Include essential project context
   - Keep concise but comprehensive
   - Update as project evolves

3. **Manual Summary Creation**
   ```bash
   # Periodically create summaries
   claude -p "Summarize our progress so far" > progress_summary.md
   ```

4. **Context Chunking**
   - Break large tasks into smaller sessions
   - Use clear handoff points
   - Document state between sessions

### External Implementation Ideas

```python
# Conceptual context manager
class ContextWindowManager:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens=200000):
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
        self.current_usage = 0
        self.summaries = []
    
    def should_compact(self):
        return self.current_usage > (0.8 * self.max_tokens)
    
    def auto_compact(self):
        if self.should_compact():
            # Trigger /compact command
            subprocess.run(['claude', '/compact'])
    
    def create_rolling_summary(self, interval=20):
        # Generate summary every N operations
        summary = subprocess.run(
            ['claude', '-p', 'Summarize last 20 operations'],
            capture_output=True
        )
        self.summaries.append(summary.stdout)
```

## Limitations Discovered

1. **No Automatic Infinite Loop Support**
   - Context window is hard limit
   - No native circular buffer implementation
   - Infinite operations eventually fail

2. **Manual Intervention Required**
   - User must trigger `/compact`
   - No programmable API for context management
   - Can't query current usage programmatically

3. **Summary Quality Varies**
   - `/compact` may lose important details
   - No control over summarization algorithm
   - Critical information might be pruned

4. **No Cross-Instance Sharing**
   - Each Claude instance has separate context
   - No native context synchronization
   - File-based sharing only option

## Comparison to Conceptual Features

| Feature | Claude Code Reality | Infinite Loop Concept |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Rolling Summary | Manual via `/compact` | Automatic generation |
| Context Pruning | User-triggered | Automatic triggers |
| Memory Management | Basic persistence | Sophisticated strategies |
| Sharing Protocols | File-based only | Real-time synchronization |

## Recommendations

1. **For Current Users**
   - Master the `/compact` command
   - Optimize CLAUDE.md usage
   - Monitor context percentage
   - Plan session boundaries

2. **For Infinite Loop Implementation**
   - Build external context monitor
   - Implement file-based summaries
   - Create checkpoint system
   - Design handoff protocols

3. **Future Development**
   - Track GitHub issue #92
   - Request API for context queries
   - Advocate for programmable compacting
   - Share use cases with Anthropic

## Conclusion

While Claude Code offers genuine context optimization features like `/compact` and automatic management, the sophisticated features imagined for infinite agent loops (rolling summaries, automatic pruning, advanced memory management) require external implementation. The foundation exists, but realizing the full vision needs additional tooling.
