- Extensible architecture
- Community server development

### 3. GitHub Integration

**GitHub Actions Support**
- Background tasks via Actions
- Automated workflows
- CI/CD integration
- Async execution capabilities

**PR Integration (Beta)**
- Tag Claude Code on pull requests
- Respond to reviewer feedback
- Fix CI errors automatically
- Modify code based on comments
- Install via `/install-github-app`

**Workflow Examples**
```yaml
# Use Claude Code in GitHub Actions
- name: Claude Code Review
  uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
  with:
    task: "Review and fix lint errors"
```

### 4. SDK for Custom Development

**Claude Code SDK**
- Build custom agents
- Create applications using core agent
- Extensible architecture
- Same foundation as Claude Code

**Development Possibilities**
- Custom tool integrations
- Domain-specific agents
- Workflow automation
- Specialized coding assistants

### 5. Additional Extension Mechanisms

**Command Line Tool Integration**
- Use any CLI tool (git, npm, etc.)
- Shell command execution
- Script automation
- Process management

**File System Access**
- Direct file manipulation
- Pattern searching capabilities
- Batch operations
- State management

**Permission System**
- Extensible permission model
- Custom security policies
- Tool-specific permissions
- Granular access control

## Comparison of Extension Types

| Extension Type | Use Case | Integration Level |
|---------------|----------|------------------|
| Slash Commands | Quick actions | Basic |
| IDE Extensions | Inline editing | Deep |
| MCP Servers | Protocol integration | Advanced |
| GitHub Integration | Workflow automation | Platform |
| SDK | Custom agents | Developer |

## Implementation Examples

### MCP Server Example
```javascript
// Basic MCP server implementation
const mcp = require('@anthropic/mcp');

const server = new mcp.Server({
  name: 'custom-mcp-server',
  version: '1.0.0',
  tools: {
    customTool: {
      description: 'Custom tool for Claude Code',
      parameters: {...},
      handler: async (params) => {
        // Tool implementation
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### IDE Extension Usage
```typescript
// VS Code extension integration
// Claude edits appear directly in editor
// No terminal switching required
```

### GitHub Integration
```bash
# Install GitHub app
/install-github-app

# Claude responds to PR comments
# @claude-code please fix the failing tests
```

## Discovered Capabilities

### Beyond Basic Extensions
1. **Protocol-Based Integration**
   - MCP enables standardized communication
   - Not limited to predefined commands
   - Dynamic capability discovery

2. **Multi-Modal Integration**
   - Terminal + IDE + Browser
   - Synchronized across environments
   - Unified context sharing

3. **Community Ecosystem**
   - Growing MCP server library
   - Open source implementations
   - Shared best practices

4. **Platform Integration**
   - GitHub as first-class citizen
   - CI/CD pipeline support
   - Code review automation

## Limitations and Considerations

### Current Constraints
- Beta status for some integrations
- IDE extensions require separate installation
- MCP protocol still evolving
- SDK documentation limited

### Future Potential
- More IDE support coming
- Expanded MCP capabilities
- Richer GitHub features
- Plugin marketplace possible

## Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Start with IDE Extensions**
   - Immediate productivity boost
   - Familiar environment
   - Low learning curve

2. **Explore MCP for Advanced Use**
   - Custom tool integration
   - Protocol-based communication
   - Extensible architecture

3. **Leverage GitHub Integration**

## Conclusion

Claude Code's extension mechanisms go far beyond slash commands, offering a rich ecosystem of integration points. The combination of IDE extensions, MCP protocol support, GitHub integration, and SDK availability creates a comprehensive platform for AI-assisted development. While slash commands provide quick access to functionality, these additional extension points enable deep integration into existing development workflows and tools. The MCP protocol particularly stands out as a forward-looking approach to standardized AI-tool communication, suggesting a future where Claude Code can seamlessly integrate with any development tool that speaks the protocol.
