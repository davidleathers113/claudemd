# Infinite Agentic Loop Prompt System

## Overview
This system enables Claude Code (or similar AI coding assistants) to autonomously generate unlimited variations of solutions by orchestrating parallel sub-agents. The pattern uses two core prompts: a specification (blueprint) and an infinite loop engine.

## File 1: `infinite.md` - The Orchestration Engine

```markdown
# Infinite Agentic Loop Engine

## Variables
- `spec_file`: Path to the specification file (e.g., `spec.md`)
- `output_dir`: Directory for generated outputs (e.g., `output`)
- `count`: Number of iterations (use "infinite" for continuous generation)

## Phase 1: Specification Analysis
Read and analyze the entire content of `{spec_file}`. Store this as `master_plan`.

## Phase 2: Output Directory Reconnaissance
1. Create `{output_dir}` if it doesn't exist
2. Scan existing iterations to understand project state
3. Create a summary of existing work (if any) to maintain context

## Phase 3: Iteration Strategy
Determine the iteration approach based on `{count}`:
- If numeric: Plan for exactly that many iterations
- If "infinite": Prepare for continuous generation with context management

## Phase 4: Parallel Agent Coordination
Execute iterations in waves of 5 parallel agents:

For each wave:
1. Calculate iteration numbers (e.g., 1-5, 6-10, etc.)
2. For each iteration in the wave:
   
   a. Create directory: `{output_dir}/generation_{iteration_number}`
   
   b. Spawn a sub-agent with this prompt:
   
   ```
   **Sub-Agent Task - Iteration {iteration_number}**
   
   You are an expert engineer executing a specific variation of a master plan.
   
   **Output Directory:** `{output_dir}/generation_{iteration_number}/`
   
   **Uniqueness Mandate:** Your solution MUST be completely unique. Consider:
   - Previous iterations generated: {previous_iteration_summary}
   - Your unique seed: Iteration {iteration_number}
   - Explore different approaches, themes, and implementations
   
   **Master Plan:**
   {master_plan}
   
   **Instructions:**
   1. Read and understand the master plan completely
   2. Generate your unique variation
   3. Save all files to your designated directory
   4. Include a brief `README.md` describing your unique approach
   ```

## Phase 5: Infinite Mode Orchestration
When `count` is "infinite":

1. **Context Management:**
   - After each wave, summarize generated iterations
   - Maintain a rolling summary of the last 20 iterations
   - Include diversity metrics in the summary

2. **Progressive Enhancement:**
   - Early iterations (1-20): Focus on exploring different approaches
   - Mid iterations (21-50): Combine successful patterns
   - Later iterations (50+): Introduce more experimental variations

3. **Resource Management:**
   - Monitor context window usage
   - If approaching limits, complete current wave and finalize
   - Save state information for potential continuation

## Execution Notes
- Always run sub-agents in parallel within waves
- Maintain iteration independence to prevent conflicts
- Focus on maximizing diversity across iterations
```

## Innovation Criteria
Each iteration should explore:
1. A unique combination not used in previous iterations
2. A fresh visual theme or interaction paradigm  
3. An unexpected solution to a common UI problem
4. Progressive enhancement based on iteration number

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir infinite-loop-project
cd infinite-loop-project

# Create the prompt files
touch infinite.md spec.md

# Create output directory
mkdir output
```

### 2. Running with Claude Code
```bash
# Start Claude Code in your project directory
claude-code

# Execute the infinite loop (syntax may vary)
/agent --prompt-file infinite.md --spec_file spec.md --output_dir output --count infinite

# Or for a specific number of iterations
/agent --prompt-file infinite.md --spec_file spec.md --output_dir output --count 20
```

### 3. Monitoring and Management
- Watch the output directory for generated files
- Monitor resource usage (Claude Code credits)
- Stop with Ctrl+C when needed
- Review generated variations for quality and uniqueness

## Best Practices

1. **Specification Design**
   - Be specific enough to ensure quality
   - Be open enough to allow creativity
   - Include evaluation criteria

2. **Resource Management**
   - Start with small batches (5-10) to test
   - Monitor credit consumption
   - Use specific counts rather than "infinite" for production work

3. **Output Curation**
   - Review generated outputs regularly
   - Save exceptional examples
   - Use insights to refine specifications

4. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Each sub-agent consumes separate context
   - Parallel execution speeds up generation
   - Context window limits will eventually stop infinite loops

## Advanced Patterns

### Self-Improving Specifications
Include evaluation criteria in your spec that each iteration can build upon:

```markdown
## Progressive Enhancement Rules
- Iterations 1-10: Establish baseline variations
- Iterations 11-20: Combine successful elements from previous iterations
- Iterations 21+: Introduce experimental features based on pattern analysis
```

### Domain-Specific Applications
- **Code Generation:** Multiple solutions to programming challenges
- **Content Creation:** Article variations, marketing copy versions
- **Design Systems:** Component library variations
- **Data Analysis:** Different approaches to the same dataset
- **Architecture:** Multiple system design proposals

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Context Window:** The infinite loop will eventually hit context limits
2. **Resource Usage:** Each iteration consumes API credits
3. **Quality Variance:** Not all iterations will be equally valuable
4. **Storage:** Large numbers of files can accumulate quickly

## Conclusion
The infinite agentic loop pattern enables massive parallel exploration of solution spaces. By combining thoughtful specifications with automated orchestration, you can generate hundreds of variations to find optimal solutions or explore creative possibilities at scale.
