Simon Couch shared a brilliant technique for injecting external library documentation:
markdown# CLAUDE.md
## ellmer Package Context
[Include the output of btw::btw("?ellmer::Chat", "{ellmer}") here]

This provides Claude with comprehensive understanding of the ellmer package,
including all functions, parameters, and usage patterns.
