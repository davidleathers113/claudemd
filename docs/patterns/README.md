## 📊 Pattern Comparison

### By Token Usage
1. **Most Efficient**: Basic CLAUDE.md with commands
2. **Moderate**: Custom commands with templates
3. **Intensive**: Multi-agent orchestrators

### By Learning Curve
1. **Beginner**: Basic configurations
2. **Intermediate**: Custom commands
3. **Advanced**: Orchestration patterns
4. **Expert**: Infinite loops, adaptive systems

### By Maintenance Needs
1. **Low**: Static CLAUDE.md files
2. **Medium**: Template-based commands
3. **High**: Complex orchestrators

## 🔧 Pattern Combinations

Some patterns work well together:

### "Full Stack Development Kit"
- Base: Web-dev CLAUDE.md
- Commands: Component generator, API builder
- Orchestrator: Task-driven for features

### "Quality Assurance Suite"
- Base: Testing-focused CLAUDE.md
- Commands: Test generator, coverage analyzer
- Orchestrator: Multi-file for test updates

### "Refactoring Toolkit"
- Base: Code quality CLAUDE.md
- Commands: Refactor assistant, debt analyzer
- Orchestrator: Adaptive for unknown codebases

## 💡 Best Practices

### Start Simple
1. Begin with basic CLAUDE.md
2. Add commands as patterns emerge
3. Graduate to orchestrators when needed

### Iterate Based on Use
- Track which commands you use most
- Note repetitive instructions
- Automate discovered patterns

### Share and Learn
- Document successful patterns
- Share with team/community
- Learn from others' approaches
